MIFCHO can be used as a tool for different purposes, current components support:

 * Accessing Firewalled Networks (similar to Goodle Secure Data Connector - http://code.google.com/p/google-secure-data-connector/)
 * Tunneling with and without SSL/TLS ( similar to http://www.stunnel.org/ and [http://www.ssh.com/support/documentation/online/ssh/winhelp/32/Local_And_Remote_Forwarding.html SSH-forwarding/tunneling] )
 * Websocket Gateway ( similar to http://www.kaazing.org/confluence/display/KAAZING/Home)
 * Adding proxy capabilities to protocols not supporting proxying by intercepting connections.

MIFCHO is used as a websocket to socket gateway by [https://github.com/safl/jsvnc jsVNC].

No releases, yet... but feel free to poke around In the source-code.
